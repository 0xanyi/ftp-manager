   cd backend
   npm install
   ```

3. Generate Prisma client and push database schema:
   ```bash
   npx prisma generate
   npx prisma db push
   ```

4. Start the backend development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. In a new terminal, install frontend dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```

6. Start the frontend development server:
