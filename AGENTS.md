# FTP Manager

Web-based FTP file management system with channel-based organization and role-based access control.

## Core Commands

â€¢ Type-check and lint (backend): `cd backend && npm run lint`
â€¢ Auto-fix style (backend): `cd backend && npm run lint:fix`
â€¢ Type-check and lint (frontend): `cd frontend && npm run lint`
â€¢ Auto-fix style (frontend): `cd frontend && npm run lint:fix`
â€¢ Run full test suite (backend): `cd backend && npm test`
â€¢ Run full test suite (frontend): `cd frontend && npm test`
â€¢ Start dev servers: `npm run dev` (from project root)
â€¢ Build for production: `npm run build` (from backend/frontend)
â€¢ Database migrations: `cd backend && npm run prisma:migrate`
â€¢ Create admin user: `cd backend && npm run create-admin`

## Project Layout

â”œâ”€ backend/ â†’ Express + TypeScript API server
â”œâ”€ frontend/ â†’ React + Vite frontend
â”œâ”€ docs/ â†’ Documentation and roadmaps
â”œâ”€ scripts/ â†’ Development and deployment scripts

â€¢ Frontend code lives **only** in `frontend/`
â€¢ Backend code lives **only** in `backend/`
â€¢ Shared configuration and docs belong in project root

## Current Status

### Phase I: Foundation & Core Infrastructure âœ… COMPLETED
- Authentication system with JWT tokens
- Role-based access control (ADMIN/CHANNEL_USER)
- Database schema with Prisma ORM
- Redis integration for caching
- Frontend React application with auth
- Admin user management system

### Phase II: File Upload & FTP Integration ðŸš§ READY TO START
- Chunked file upload endpoints
- FTP connection management
- File validation and security
- Upload progress tracking
- File management API

## Development Patterns & Constraints

### Coding Style
â€¢ TypeScript strict mode with proper type definitions
â€¢ 100-char line limit, 2-space indentation
â€¢ Use interfaces for public APIs; avoid `@ts-ignore`
â€¢ Conventional commit messages: `type(scope): description`
â€¢ Tests first when implementing new features
â€¢ Visual diff loop for UI components

### Security Requirements
â€¢ Password complexity: 8+ chars, uppercase, lowercase, number, special
â€¢ Input validation with Joi schemas
â€¢ Parameterized queries via Prisma ORM
â€¢ JWT authentication with refresh tokens
â€¢ Role-based endpoint protection
â€¢ File name and path sanitization

### Database Operations
â€¢ Always use Prisma for database operations
â€¢ Use transactions for related operations
â€¢ Handle errors gracefully with proper logging
â€¢ Maintain indexes for performance

## Git Workflow Essentials

1. Branch from `main` with descriptive name: `feature/<slug>` or `bugfix/<slug>`.
2. Run lint and type checks locally **before** committing.
3. Force pushes **allowed only** on feature branches using `git push --force-with-lease`. Never force-push `main`.
4. Keep commits atomic; prefer checkpoints (`feat: â€¦`, `test: â€¦`, `fix: â€¦`).
5. **ALWAYS commit after each new function** - one function per commit.

## Evidence Required for Every Task

A task is considered complete when it includes:

- All tests passing (`npm test` in respective directory)
- Lint & type check pass (`npm run lint`)
- **IDE diagnostics check** - run `getIdeDiagnostics` on all modified files
- **Proof artifact**
  â€¢ Bug fix â†’ failing test added first, now passes
  â€¢ Feature â†’ new tests demonstrating behavior
  â€¢ UI change â†’ visual proof of functionality
- Atomic commits with descriptive messages
- No drop in code quality or coverage

## MANDATORY Development Practices

**CRITICAL WORKFLOW - MUST FOLLOW FOR EVERY FUNCTION:**

1. **Create feature branch before ANY code changes**
2. **Write secure, best practice code** - No exceptions
3. **Write tests immediately for each function**
4. **Run IDE diagnostics and fix all errors**
5. **Commit after each new function** - One function per commit
6. **Clean up test scripts once passing**

## Planning Requirements

**Before Starting Work:**
- Write detailed implementation plan in `tasks/TASK_NAME.md`
- Include clear breakdown of implementation steps
- Focus on Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
- Request approval before implementing

**While Implementing:**
- Keep plan updated with progress
- Document any changes or discoveries
- Note any blockers or dependencies

## Quick Start

1. Clone repository and copy `.env.example` to `.env.development`
2. Start development environment: `docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d`
3. Install dependencies: `cd backend && npm install && cd ../frontend && npm install`
4. Run database migrations: `cd backend && npm run prisma:migrate`
5. Create admin user: `cd backend && npm run create-admin`
6. Start dev servers: `npm run dev` (from project root)
7. Access at: Frontend http://localhost:5174, Backend http://localhost:3000

## Admin Access

Default admin credentials (after running create-admin):
- Email: `admin@example.com`
- Password: `AdminPassword123!`

## API Endpoints

### Authentication
- `POST /api/auth/login` - User login
- `POST /api/auth/create-admin` - Create admin (admin only)
- `GET /api/auth/me` - Get current user
- `POST /api/auth/logout` - Logout
- `POST /api/auth/refresh` - Refresh token

### Files (Phase II - Coming Soon)
- File upload endpoints with chunking
- File download and management
- Progress tracking via WebSocket

## Security Checklist

- [ ] Input validation on all endpoints
- [ ] Rate limiting implemented
- [ ] HTTPS in production
- [ ] File type and size restrictions
- [ ] Path traversal prevention
- [ ] Admin-only endpoint protection
- [ ] JWT token security
- [ ] Database query safety
