## Development Patterns & Constraints

### Coding Style
• TypeScript strict mode with proper type definitions
• 100-char line limit, 2-space indentation
• Use interfaces for public APIs; avoid `@ts-ignore`
• Conventional commit messages: `type(scope): description`
• Tests first when implementing new features
• Visual diff loop for UI components

### Security Requirements
• Password complexity: 8+ chars, uppercase, lowercase, number, special
• Input validation with Joi schemas
• Parameterized queries via Prisma ORM
• JWT authentication with refresh tokens
• Role-based endpoint protection
• File name and path sanitization
• CSRF token validation on state-changing requests (`GET /api/security/csrf-token` + `x-csrf-token` header)
• Malware scanning before FTP transfer

### Database Operations
• Always use Prisma for database operations
• Use transactions for related operations
• Handle errors gracefully with proper logging
• Maintain indexes for performance

## Git Workflow Essentials

1. Branch from `main` with descriptive name: `feature/<slug>` or `bugfix/<slug>`.
2. Run lint and type checks locally **before** committing.
3. Force pushes **allowed only** on feature branches using `git push --force-with-lease`. Never force-push `main`.
4. Keep commits atomic; prefer checkpoints (`feat: …`, `test: …`, `fix: …`).
5. **ALWAYS commit after each new function** - one function per commit.

## Evidence Required for Every Task

A task is considered complete when it includes:

- All tests passing (`npm test` in respective directory)
- Lint & type check pass (`npm run lint`)
- **IDE diagnostics check** - run `getIdeDiagnostics` on all modified files
- **Proof artifact**
  • Bug fix → failing test added first, now passes
  • Feature → new tests demonstrating behavior
  • UI change → visual proof of functionality
- Atomic commits with descriptive messages
- No drop in code quality or coverage

## MANDATORY Development Practices

**CRITICAL WORKFLOW - MUST FOLLOW FOR EVERY FUNCTION:**

1. **Create feature branch before ANY code changes**
2. **Write secure, best practice code** - No exceptions
3. **Write tests immediately for each function**
4. **Run IDE diagnostics and fix all errors**
5. **Commit after each new function** - One function per commit
6. **Clean up test scripts once passing**

## Planning Requirements

**Before Starting Work:**
- Write detailed implementation plan in `tasks/TASK_NAME.md`
- Include clear breakdown of implementation steps
- Focus on Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
- Request approval before implementing

**While Implementing:**
- Keep plan updated with progress
- Document any changes or discoveries
- Note any blockers or dependencies

## Quick Start

1. Clone repository and copy `.env.example` to `.env.development`
2. Start development environment: `docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d`

4. Run database migrations: `cd backend && npm run prisma:migrate`
5. Create admin user: `cd backend && npm run create-admin`
