# Production Readiness Audit

## Objective

Validate the actual implementation status of production-readiness tasks and reconcile project documentation before deployment.

## Plan

1. Catalog outstanding checklist items from `docs/implementation-roadmap.md` and `AGENTS.md` that require verification.
2. Inspect backend security and performance features (rate limiting, validation, security headers, CSRF, file scanning, audit logging, caching, monitoring) to confirm implementation status.
3. Review backend tests directory and configuration to assess unit, integration, and end-to-end coverage claims.
4. Examine deployment and CI/CD setup (Docker images, Coolify configs, GitHub Actions, backup/health checks) to determine completion state.
5. Identify documentation updates needed, including marking HTTPS as handled by Coolify and aligning checklist statuses with verified implementation.
6. Compile findings into a concise readiness summary with confirmed completions and remaining blockers for production launch.

## Dependencies / Questions

- Confirm whether any private infrastructure repositories exist for deployment artifacts not stored here.
- Validate if external services (monitoring, backups) are configured outside the repo or remain pending.
