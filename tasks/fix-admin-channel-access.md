# Fix Admin Channel Access and User Assignment State

## Problem
1. After assigning a user to a channel in the admin interface, the state is not reflected when navigating back to the home page or refreshing
2. Admin users cannot see all channels by default - they only see channels they're explicitly assigned to
3. Cache is not being invalidated after user channel assignments are updated

## Root Causes
1. **Cache not invalidated**: The `updateUserChannels` function in `userController.ts` doesn't invalidate the user's channel cache after updating assignments
2. **Admin channel access**: The `/auth/me` endpoint only returns explicitly assigned channels for all users, including admins. Admins should see ALL active channels by default
3. **Frontend not refreshing**: The AuthContext stores user data in localStorage and doesn't refresh after channel assignments change

## Solution

### Backend Changes

#### 1. Fix `/auth/me` endpoint to return all channels for admins
**File**: `backend/src/routes/auth.ts` (line 210-249)

- If user is ADMIN, return ALL active channels
- If user is CHANNEL_USER, return only assigned channels

#### 2. Add cache invalidation to `updateUserChannels`
**File**: `backend/src/controllers/userController.ts` (line 482-580)

- Import CacheService
- Call `CacheService.invalidateUserCaches(id)` after transaction completes

#### 3. Add cache invalidation to `updateChannelUsers`
**File**: `backend/src/controllers/channelController.ts` (line 492-571)

- Import CacheService
- Call cache invalidation for affected users after assignments change

### Testing
1. Create a test user (CHANNEL_USER role)
2. As admin, assign user to a channel
3. Refresh page and verify user channels are updated
4. Verify admin can see all channels
5. Verify admin can upload to any channel
