# ToovyDrop - Coolify Deployment Guide

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for deploying ToovyDrop to Coolify using individual Docker applications for better management and diagnostics.

## Prerequisites

- [ ] Coolify instance running and accessible
- [ ] Domain names configured and pointing to your Coolify server
- [ ] Git repository accessible from Coolify
- [ ] FTP server details (external)
- [ ] SSL certificates configured (automatic with Coolify + Let's Encrypt)

## Deployment Architecture

ToovyDrop is deployed as **separate applications** in Coolify for easier management:
- **Frontend Application**: React + Vite (Nginx) - `frontend/Dockerfile.production`
- **Backend Application**: Node.js + Express API - `backend/Dockerfile.production`

Plus external database services:
- **PostgreSQL**: Primary database (external service or Coolify managed)
- **Dragonfly**: Cache and session store (Coolify managed service - Redis alternative)

> **📋 Database Services**: This guide covers deployment with individual Docker applications and external databases.
> PostgreSQL can be external or Coolify-managed. Dragonfly (Redis alternative) is deployed as a Coolify service.
> For detailed external database setup, see `docs/external-database-setup.md`

CHUNK_SIZE=5242880
ENABLE_MALWARE_SCAN=true
CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://yourdomain.com
CSP_ADDITIONAL_CONNECT_SRC=https://api.yourdomain.com,wss://api.yourdomain.com
LOG_LEVEL=info
LOG_FILE=/app/logs/app.log
```

> **Tip:** For multiple frontend domains (e.g., admin portals), provide a
> comma-separated list in `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` and mirror the API/WebSocket
> endpoints in `CSP_ADDITIONAL_CONNECT_SRC`.

### 4.4 Backend Domain Configuration
1. Go to **"Domains"** tab in backend application
2. Add your API domain: `api.yourdomain.com`
3. Enable **"Generate SSL Certificate"** (Let's Encrypt)

## Step 5: Deploy Frontend Application

### 5.1 Create Frontend Application
1. Click **"New Resource"** → **"Application"**
2. Select **"Docker Image"** → **"From Git Repository"**

### 5.2 Frontend Configuration
```
Application Name: toovydrop-frontend
Repository URL: https://github.com/yourusername/ftp-manager
Branch: main
Build Pack: Dockerfile
Dockerfile Location: ./frontend/Dockerfile.production
Base Directory: frontend/
```

### 5.3 Frontend Environment Variables (Build-time)

**API Configuration (Required for build):**
```bash
VITE_API_URL=https://api.yourdomain.com
VITE_WS_URL=wss://api.yourdomain.com
```

> **Important**: These must be set as **"Available at Buildtime"** in Coolify since Vite needs them during the build process.

### 5.4 Frontend Domain Configuration
1. Go to **"Domains"** tab in frontend application
2. Add your frontend domain: `yourdomain.com`
3. Enable **"Generate SSL Certificate"** (Let's Encrypt)

### 5.5 Frontend Network Configuration
1. Go to **"Network"** tab
2. Set **"Ports Exposes"** to: `80`
3. Save configuration

## Step 6: DNS Configuration

Configure your domain's DNS records:
```
A    yourdomain.com        YOUR_SERVER_IP
A    api.yourdomain.com    YOUR_SERVER_IP
```

## Step 7: Deploy Applications

### 7.1 Deploy Backend First
1. In backend application, click **"Deploy"**
2. Monitor build and deployment logs
3. Wait for healthy status (2-3 minutes)
4. Check logs for successful database migration

### 7.2 Deploy Frontend
1. In frontend application, click **"Deploy"**
2. Monitor build process (Vite build with environment variables)
3. Wait for healthy status (1-2 minutes)

### 7.3 Service Health Check
Verify all services are running:
- ✅ **toovydrop-dragonfly** (Dragonfly cache)
- ✅ **toovydrop-postgres** (PostgreSQL database - if managed)
- ✅ **toovydrop-backend** (Node.js API)
- ✅ **toovydrop-frontend** (Nginx + React)

## Step 8: Post-Deployment Configuration

### 8.1 Database Migrations (Automatic)
Database migrations now run automatically during backend deployment. The backend container will:
1. Run `npx prisma migrate deploy` on startup
2. Apply any pending migrations safely
3. Start the application server

> **Note**: If you need to run migrations manually, you can still access the backend container:
> ```bash
> # Via Coolify terminal
> docker exec -it toovydrop-backend sh
> npx prisma migrate deploy
> ```

### 8.2 Create Admin User
```bash
# In backend container terminal
node dist/scripts/createAdmin.js
```

### 8.3 Verify Application
1. Navigate to `https://yourdomain.com`
2. Test login with admin credentials:
   - Email: `admin@example.com`
   - Password: `AdminPassword123!`

## Step 9: Application Management

### 9.1 Individual Service Management
Each service can be managed independently:

**Backend Application:**
- View logs, metrics, and performance
- Restart, rebuild, or redeploy independently
- Monitor API health and database connections
- Scale resources as needed

**Frontend Application:**
- Monitor nginx performance
- Update frontend without affecting backend
- Independent SSL certificate management
- CDN-ready static asset serving

**Database Services:**
- Monitor Dragonfly cache hit rates
- PostgreSQL query performance
- Independent backup and scaling

### 9.2 Volume Mounts
Coolify automatically creates persistent volumes for backend:
- `backend_uploads`: File uploads storage
- `backend_logs`: Application logs storage

Database storage is managed by respective database services.

## Step 10: Monitoring and Maintenance

### 10.1 Health Monitoring
Coolify automatically monitors each application:
- Individual service health checks
- Resource usage per application
- SSL certificate expiry for each domain
- Application-specific metrics

### 10.2 Log Access
Access logs for each service independently:
- **Backend logs**: API requests, database operations, file uploads
- **Frontend logs**: Nginx access logs, static file serving
- **Dragonfly logs**: Cache operations and performance
- **PostgreSQL logs**: Database queries and performance (if managed)

### 10.3 Backup Strategy
Configure backups per service:
- **Database**: PostgreSQL dumps (automated in Coolify)
- **Files**: Backend upload directory snapshots
- **Configuration**: Environment variables export per application
- **Dragonfly**: Cache data (optional, as it's regenerated)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**1. Frontend Bad Gateway (502)**
```bash
# Check frontend port configuration
# Ensure "Ports Exposes" is set to 80 in frontend network settings
```

**2. Backend API Connection Issues**
```bash
# Check backend health
curl -I https://api.yourdomain.com/api/health
# Check backend logs in Coolify dashboard
```

**3. Dragonfly Connection Errors**
```bash
# Verify Dragonfly service is running
# Check REDIS_URL format in backend environment variables
# Format: redis://:password@toovydrop-dragonfly:6379/0
```

**4. Database Connection Errors**
```bash
# Check PostgreSQL service health (if managed)
# Verify DATABASE_URL format in backend environment
# Test connection from backend container
```

**5. File Upload Issues**
```bash
# Check backend upload directory permissions
docker exec -it toovydrop-backend sh
ls -la /app/uploads
```

**6. Build-time Environment Variables**
```bash
# Ensure frontend VITE_ variables are set as "Available at Buildtime"
# Check frontend build logs for environment variable errors
```

### Performance Optimization

**1. Resource Limits per Application**
Set appropriate limits in Coolify for each service:
```
Frontend: 512MB RAM, 0.5 CPU
Backend: 1GB RAM, 1 CPU  
PostgreSQL: 1GB RAM, 1 CPU (if managed)
Dragonfly: 256MB RAM, 0.25 CPU
```

**2. Dragonfly Optimization**
```bash
# Monitor cache hit rates in Dragonfly logs
# Adjust memory limits based on usage patterns
# Dragonfly auto-scales better than Redis for high concurrency
```
